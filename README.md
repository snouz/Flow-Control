## Rotatable Pipe Sections

Using these three new pipe sections you can build almost any pipe layout without worrying about unwanted connections. Each pipe is crafted from one normal pipe, and when mined drops a normal pipe.

- **Elbow**
- **T-Junction**
- **Straight**

When construction ghosts or blueprints of these sections are placed, construction bots are able to build them using normal pipes.

## Settings
