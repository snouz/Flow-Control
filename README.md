# Flow Control

This mod has two main features: specific rotatable pipe sections and valves.

## Rotatable Pipe Sections

Using these three new pipe sections you can build almost any pipe layout without worrying about unwanted connections. Each pipe is crafted from one normal pipe, and when mined drops a normal pipe.

- **Elbow**
- **T-Junction**
- **Straight**

When construction ghosts or blueprints of these sections are placed, construction bots are able to build them using normal pipes.

## Valves

One-way, overflow and top-up valves have been moved to the  [Valves](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/valves) mod.

## Settings

- **New subgroup for pipe items** (enabled by default): Moves pipes, pumps and valves to a new line in the crafting menu
- **Picked up pipes become base pipes** (enabled by default): When picking up T-Junction, elbow or straight pipes, it reverts back to normal pipes.
