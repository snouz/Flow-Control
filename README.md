## Rotatable Pipe Sections

Using these three new pipe sections you can build almost any pipe layout without worrying about unwanted connections. Each pipe is crafted from one normal pipe, and when mined drops a normal pipe.

- **Elbow**
- **T-Junction**
- **Straight**

When construction ghosts or blueprints of these sections are placed, bots are able to build them using normal pipes.

## Valves
Overflow, top-up and check valves have been moved to the optional [Valves](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/valves) mod.

## Settings

- **New subgroup for pipe items** (enabled by default): Moves pipes, pumps and valves to a new line in the crafting menu
- **Picked up pipes become base pipes** (enabled by default): When picking up T-Junction, elbow or straight pipes, they revert back to normal pipes.
