# Flow Control

This mod has two main features: specific rotatable pipe sections and valves.

## Specific Rotatable Pipe Seconds

Using these three new pipe sections you can build almost any pipe layout without worrying about unwanted connections. Each pipe is crafted from one normal pipe, and when mined drops a normal pipe.

- **Elbow**
- **T-Junction**
- **Straight**

## Valves

This mod includes three valves from the [Valves](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/valves) mod.
- **One way valve:** Only allows flow in one direction, when the input fluid level is higher than the output fluid level.
- **Overflow valve:** Only allows flow in one direction when the input is higher than 80% full.
- **Top up valve:** Only allows flow in one direction when the output is higher than 50% full.

These thresholds are also customizable with easy shortcuts (`Numpad +/-`) with the defaults configurable in the map settings.

## Settings

- **Picked up pipes become base pipes** (enabled by default): When picking up T-Junction, elbow or straight pipes, it reverts back to normal pipes.
