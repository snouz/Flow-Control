This mod adds three valves and three rotatable pipe shapes with limited connectivity.
The valves and pump are unlocked by researching **Fluid handling**, the pipes have no research requirement.

## Non-return valve
- Also known as a check valve, this allows full-speed flow in one direction, indicated by the green arrow.
- Can output its fluid level to red/green wires.
- Recipe: 1 iron plate, 1 iron gear, 1 pipe

## Overflow valve
- Allows flow in the direction of the orange arrow, but only when the input pressure is above 80% (i.e. the attached pipe or tank is 80% full). The maximum flow rate of the overflow valve is less than a regular pipe.  Useful as an outlet for excess production, for example cracking excess heavy oil when lubricant supply exceeds demand.
- Can output its fluid level to red/green wires.
- Recipe: 1 electronic circuit, 1 iron plate, 1 iron gear, 1 pipe

## Top-up valve
- Allows flow in the direction of the white arrow, but only when the output pressure is below 80% (i.e. the attached pipe or tank is less than 80% full). The maximum flow rate of the float valve is less than a regular pipe.  Useful for topping up or acting as a reduced-priority fluid input. Note that a small amount of fluid will remain in this valve when the pipe is emptied.
- Can output its fluid level to red/green wires.
- Recipe: 1 electronic circuit, 1 iron plate, 1 iron gear, 1 pipe

## Pipes
- Elbow, T-junction and straight pipes, that only connect in appropriate directions. Each pipe is crafted from one normal pipe, and when mined drops a normal pipe.

## Settings

- **New subgroup for pipe items** (enabled by default): Moves pipes, pumps and valves to a new line in the crafting menu
- **Picked up pipes become base pipes** (enabled by default): When picking up T-Junction, elbow or straight pipes, it reverts back to normal pipes.
